## (1) First, install git...

And then we'll get down to business.


http://git-scm.com/downloads


Please download for your appropriate OS.

## (2) Let me try to guide you...


and not hold your hand.

So, what is version control? 

Who is Linus Torvalds?

When is the last time you've saved multiple drafts of a project? 

Own up to it. Now.

## (3) An Illustration of Version Control (thanks Kostis)

## (4) Let me show you a quick example (locally, of course)

Remember these two commands: "cd" and "ls" (also, "clear").

Here is what we're going to do. 

1. Create file. (create rocket ship)
2. Initiate git repository (prepare station)
3. Add file to be tracked (prep the launch pad)
4. Commit the file (launch the rocket ship from pad)
5. Wash, rinse, and repeat

Why would this be good when working with numerous lines of code?

## (5) Let me show you a quick example (locally, of course)

Remember these two commands: "cd" and "ls" (also, "clear").

Here is what we're going to do. 

1. Create file. 
2. git init
3. git add 
4. git commit -m "present tense message"
5. Repeat! (and check logs: git log)

## (6) Branches (later in the semester/life)

```
git branch iss91v2
git checkout iss91v2
```

![Branches][link0.1]

They will eventually merge.

## (7) RStudio (Nick's video is ONLY 5 minutes)

0. Create a GitHub profile (free and open source!)
1. Let's use my lame GitHub repository for a quick example and copy the link in the bottom right corner.
2. Create a new R project!
  - *New Project* -> *Version Control* -> *Git* -> *Insert URL and Directory Name* -> *shazam!*
3. *deep breath* This is a lot to take in.
  - Compare local and online files (they should be the same).
  - Let's make a **local** edit to the README.md file 
  - Next, let's look at the Git tab in our Environment/History pane.
  - *Check the box* for the edited file and hit *Commit*
  - *Insert a message*, click *Commit*, and then *push* the file.
  - FINALLY, check the online file to view the *pushed* changes.

## (8) And finally, finally...

Give yourself a pat on the back.

## (9) Resources

There are GUI's available but experiment with the terminal. It's "fun".
Check these links out for additional help:

## (10) Dreaded Homework (git & GitHub)

0. Now is the time to organize your local folders and clean house! 
1. Download git for your appropriate OS
2. Create a GitHub profile and repository.
3. upload a picture if you'd like
4. Create an informative README.md
5. Copy the online repo into a local repo/new R project.
6. Create a *.Rmd homework file from slide (11) and push it back up. 

---

## (11) Dreaded Homework cont. (tidyr & dplyr)

1. Skim/read the tidyr paper (piazza)
2. Here's a link to a [condensed version][link7] of tidyr.
3. And Hadley's repo: https://github.com/hadley/tidyr
4. From the ggplot2 package, tidy up the "movies" data set.
5. Specifically, variables r1:r10 and Action:Short.
6. From the cafe data set, explain how you would tidy it up. Which variables?
7. "Un-tidy" the data set by the variable Day Code/ Day of Week.
